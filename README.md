# drake-kuka-driver

This repository contains the application code used to communicate with
the KUKA iiwa are from Drake.  Communicating with the arm requires two
pieces, a Java application to run on the KUKA Sunrise cabinet, and an
local C++ application communicating with the cabinet using the FRI
protocol.

TODO(sam.creasey) Add a section explaining the FRI C++ portions, the externals, and building the resulting driver

TODO(sam.creasey) Add a section explaining Sunrise Workbench and the Java application.
